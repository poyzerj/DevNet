Iterative and Incremental
- Why came into picture:
    - Large set of changes
    - Long delay b/w development and deployment
    - Slow time to market
    - Zero work/life balance
- Deliver faster and more reliably
- Easier integration
- Faster time to deployment
- Human centric

Continuous and Automated
- Continuous makes deployment routine
- Automation makes automation reliable

End to End Responsibility
- Organizational and functionality visibility
- Brings different roles in an organizations together
- Feedback and intrumentation

Infrastructure as a Code:
- Infrastructure as a code (IaC) is an infrastructure management approach that makes continuous delivery and DevOps possible.
Containerization:
- Using containers to simulate exact environment.
Microservices
- The microservice architectural approach entails building one application as a set of independent services that communicate with each other, but are configured individually
Cloud Infrastructure
- Using public cloud services to eliminate server-management operations.
