#Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment

##Continuous Integration

- Automating the combination of code changes from multiple contributers into a single code base

- Components:
    - Source Code Control
        - Version Control Management System
        - Eg: git
    - Build Automation
        - Automatic Compilation
    - Unit Testing
        - Automating the testing of individual components of software
        - Test Driven Development
    - Branch Merging
        - Merging Branches
    - Integration Testing
        - How the individual components come together
        
##Continuous Deployment

- Automating the delivery of IT services to the users

- Components:
    - Central Repository
        - Pushing the code into the centralized Repository
    - System Testing
        - How entire system is tested
        - Code has access to all system resources it needs
    - Deployment
        - Environment cloning
        - Infrastructure as code
    - User-Acceptance Testing
